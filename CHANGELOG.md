## [3.2.3] - 14/05-2022

### Fixed

- Get-SteamServerInfo
  - Fixes name property in output when no challenge is sent. Thanks [ThePoShWolf](https://github.com/ThePoShWolf)!

## [3.2.2] - 13/05-2022

Please note there were a minor error in Get-SteamServerInfo in this version.
Therefore, 3.2.2 has been hidden in the PowerShell Gallery.

### Fixed

- Get-SteamServerInfo
  - Support the server challenge request (Linux based servers) ([#47](https://github.com/hjorslev/SteamPS/issues/47)).
  Thanks [ThePoShWolf](https://github.com/ThePoShWolf)!
- Update-SteamApp
  - Fix a warning SteamCMD displays about the force_install_dir parameter needs to
  be called prior to the login parameter.

## [3.2.1] - 04/04-2021

### Fixe3

- Get-PacketString
  - Fixes an issue in `Get-SteamServerInfo` that caused the cmdlet to display an
  error when querying a Valheim server ([#41](https://github.com/hjorslev/SteamPS/issues/41)).
  Thanks [ThePoShWolf](https://github.com/ThePoShWolf)!

## [3.2.0] - 13/09-2020

### Added

- New cmdlets that can interact with the Steam Web API
  - Connect-SteamAPI
  - Get-SteamFriendList
  - Get-SteamNews
  - Get-SteamPlayerBan
  - Get-SteamPlayerSummary
  - Resolve-VanityURL

### Changed

- Logging is now handled using *PSFramework* rather than the module *Logging*. Output
of log files are stored in CSV format with more information about the system etc.
- Get-SteamServerInfo
  - Write the error, if the server cannot be reached, instead of throwing it. This
  is implemented because if the server could not be reached after using Update-SteamServer,
  the workflow would be terminated, the first time the server could not be reached,
  instead of attempting to test it again.

### Fixed

- Update-SteamServer
  - Fixed issue regarding the log file not being created due to a missing
  sub directory preventing any logging until the directory is created ([#29](https://github.com/hjorslev/SteamPS/issues/29)).
  - Fixed issue with the update workflow being corrupted if the server were offline
  at the beginning of the update ([#30](https://github.com/hjorslev/SteamPS/issues/30)).
- Update-SteamApp
  - Remove the validate parameter when calling SteamCMD. Validation will overwrite
  any files that have been changed. This may cause issues with customized
  servers ([#33](https://github.com/hjorslev/SteamPS/issues/33)).

## [3.1.1] - 12/07-2020

### Fixed

- Fix issue with error being thrown when adding SteamCMD location to PATH ([#24](https://github.com/hjorslev/SteamPS/issues/24)).
- Find-SteamAppID
  - Fix changed API url.

## [3.1.0] - 07/07-2020

### Added

- Update-SteamServer
  - Added `-Credential` parameter so apps that requires authentication can be
  updated ([#16](https://github.com/hjorslev/SteamPS/issues/16)).
- Update-SteamApp
  - Output ExitCode from SteamCMD if it has another value than 0 (success).

### Changed

- Improving structure / format of the code.
  - Remove sub-expressions where they are not needed.
- Dependencies are now handled in the module manifest instead of using custom
cmdlet `Use-Module`.
- Update-SteamServer
  - Fix minor issue with TimeoutLimit being hardcoded when writing to the log
  instead of using the value defined in the parameter `$TimeoutLimit`.
- Update tests to Pester 5. Thanks [Joel Sallow](https://github.com/vexx32/)!
  - ModuleValidation - general tests of the module.
  - Help - tests that each cmdlet uses Comment Based Help.

### Removed

- Remove private cmdlet Use-Module.

## [3.0.0] - 19/05-2020

### Fixed

- Place external help inside module folder instead of the project folder.

### Changed

- Update-SteamServer
  - Change parameter ApplicationPath to Path. Set old parameter as an alias.
  - Change parameter LogLocation to LogPath. Set old parameter as an alias.
- Get-SteamServerInfo
  - The cmdlet now uses Steam server queries to fetch data about the server. Added
  new parameters `-IPAddress`, `-Port` and `-Timeout`. Removed parameter `-ServerID`
  since the cmdlet is no longer dependent on Rust Server Info.
